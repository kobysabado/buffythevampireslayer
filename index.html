    <p style="line-height:2rem"><strong>Buffy Anne Summers</strong> was a Slayer activated in the late 20th century. Born on January 19, 1981, she was called to be the Slayer in 1996 at the age of fifteen. <strong>Buffy</strong> was originally living in Los Angeles; but, due to an incident involving a gang of vampires at Hemery High School,
    she moved to Sunnydale with her mother. There, she acted as guardian of the Hellmouth for seven years before the town's destruction in mid-2003.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="line-height:2rem">Initially a reluctant hero who constantly wished for nothing more than a normal life, <strong>Buffy</strong> eventually grew to embrace her destiny. Buffy was unique as a Slayer in many ways; she refused to sacrifice her ordinary life for her supernatural destiny,
    often operated as part of a team with her friends the <strong>Scooby Gang</strong>, and had romantic relationships with notorious vampires Angel and Spike.</p>
