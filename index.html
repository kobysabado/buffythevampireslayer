<!--A step by step guide to setting up your HTML doc.
This greyed out text is a comment.-->

<!--1. ok, so we're ALWAYS going to define our HTML docs as HTML using this line:-->
 <!DOCTYPE html>

 <!--2. Then this line is specifying that we're reading HTML now, and specifying the LANGUAGE for the content of the document with the "lang" attribute-->
<html lang="en">

<!--3. We start out our doc with a <head> tag in order to link up whatever we need. This is where your styles are linked, and your scripts.-->
  <head>

<!--4.The first bit in the header should be a <meta> tag that specifies the character encoding of the page.
Specifying it here ensures the document is displayed correctly even when itâ€™s loaded directly from disk, without consulting a server.-->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

<!--5. Define the name of your page so it shows up in your browser tab here-->
    <title>Home</title>

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Mono:wght@200;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

  </head>

  <body style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">

<!--6. Now you get to the content of your page with the <body> tag.-->
    <h1>Naomi Smalls</h1>
    <h2>One of my favourite drag queens</h2>
    <h4>I love her so much!! <3 </h4>
