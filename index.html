    <i>"Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> is an American television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon, which aired from 1997–2003.
    It featured the exploits of the <strong>Slayer Buffy Summers</strong> and her group of friends, the <strong>Scooby Gang</strong>, as they protected Sunnydale from <span style="font-weight:700">vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness."</span>

    <p style="line-height:2rem"><strong>Buffy Anne Summers</strong> is the title character of the <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> franchise. She first appeared in the 1992 film <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> before going on to appear in the television series and subsequent comic book of the same name.
    The character has also appeared in the spin-off series <i>Angel</i>, as well as numerous non-canon expanded universe material, such as novels, comics, and video games. Buffy was portrayed by Kristy Swanson in the film, and later by <span style="font-weight:700">Sarah Michelle Gellar</span> in the television series.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="line-height:2rem"><strong>Buffy Anne Summers</strong> was a Slayer activated in the late 20th century. Born on January 19, 1981, she was called to be the Slayer in 1996 at the age of fifteen. <strong>Buffy</strong> was originally living in Los Angeles; but, due to an incident involving a gang of vampires at Hemery High School,
    she moved to Sunnydale with her mother. There, she acted as guardian of the Hellmouth for seven years before the town's destruction in mid-2003.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="line-height:2rem">Initially a reluctant hero who constantly wished for nothing more than a normal life, <strong>Buffy</strong> eventually grew to embrace her destiny. Buffy was unique as a Slayer in many ways; she refused to sacrifice her ordinary life for her supernatural destiny,
    often operated as part of a team with her friends the <strong>Scooby Gang</strong>, and had romantic relationships with notorious vampires <strong>Angel and Spike</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Summers" target="_blank">(Wikipedia.org)</a></p>

    <p style="line-height:2rem">The <strong>Scooby Gang</strong> was the core group formed after the arrival of <strong>Buffy Summers</strong> to Sunnydale in order to battle the supernatural forces of evil, and assist <strong>Buffy</strong> in her duties as the Slayer.
    <strong>The Scoobies</strong>, as its members were known, were originally teenage friends attending Sunnydale High School in a town built on top of a Hellmouth. With time, the group gradually expanded with new members and allies in worldwide activity against the forces of darkness.

    <p style="line-height:2rem">After moving to <strong>Sunnydale, California, Buffy Anne Summers</strong> just wants to be a normal teenager. Back in <strong>Los Angeles,</strong> her first <strong>Watcher</strong> had died; she inadvertently burned down the school gymnasium at her old high school; and her parents got a divorce.
    The move to Sunnydale is supposed to give both her and her mother, <strong>Joyce</strong>, a clean slate. But then she meets the school librarian, <strong>Rupert Giles</strong>, and quickly learns there is no escaping her destiny. With <stron>Giles</strong> as her new <strong>Watcher,</strong> she reluctantly steps back into her role as the <strong>Slayer</strong>.
    But this time she is not fighting alone. She now has an inner circle of special friends — <strong>Willow, Xander, Cordelia</strong>, and a mysterious young man named <strong>Angel</strong> — ready to join the fight and drive in a stake or two if need be.</p>

    <p style="line-height:2rem">After her death at the hands of the <strong>Master</strong> and a summer vacation spent with her father, <strong>Buffy</strong> returns to Sunnydale in a strangely withdrawn and snappy mood. She's also determined to break off her relationship with <strong>Angel</strong> and seems a little too eager to renew her <strong>Slayer</strong> training.
    But getting Angel out of her blood proves to be harder than she thought. And as the two draw even closer together, their passion erupts into a danger neither of them could have foreseen — affecting not only Vampire and Slayer, but all of Buffy's friends and family and even her Watcher.</p>

    <h2>THE BEST SHOW EVER</h2>
    <p style="line-height:2rem">I first started watching <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> 2 years ago and have watched it's entirety twice. I have never watched a show this good and will personally say that it is the best t.v show EVER. If I had to rank the seasons from best to worst, It'd be season 5, 6, 3, 7, 1, 2 and 4. However, each season has their shining moments and have something to offer. I wish they continued filming the
    show because the stories and characters are amazing. <strong>Joss Whedon</strong> did an amazing job with directing the show and can't say there's anything like it. This show follows <strong>Buffy,</strong> a strong female lead character kicking ass and continuosly saving the world from the apocalypse.</p>
