<!--A step by step guide to setting up your HTML doc.
This greyed out text is a comment.-->

<!--1. ok, so we're ALWAYS going to define our HTML docs as HTML using this line:-->
 <!DOCTYPE html>

 <!--2. Then this line is specifying that we're reading HTML now, and specifying the LANGUAGE for the content of the document with the "lang" attribute-->
<html lang="en">

<!--3. We start out our doc with a <head> tag in order to link up whatever we need. This is where your styles are linked, and your scripts.-->
  <head>

<!--4.The first bit in the header should be a <meta> tag that specifies the character encoding of the page.
Specifying it here ensures the document is displayed correctly even when itâ€™s loaded directly from disk, without consulting a server.-->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

<!--5. Define the name of your page so it shows up in your browser tab here-->
    <title>This is where you put your page title. This could be Home, About, etc.</title>

  </head>

<!--6. Now you get to the content of your page with the <body> tag.-->
  <body>
    <h1>Here is the title for the page</h1>
    <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
    <h6>This us an h6 heading</h6>

    <p>Anything you write in here will show up in your page</p>
<!--You can include any tag you want in here. Make sure you are using the correct tag for the content you want.
For example, if you want an image, use the "img" tag and make sure you are adding the correct ATTRIBUTES-->
  </body>

</html>
